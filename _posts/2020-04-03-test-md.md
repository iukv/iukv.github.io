# Hello World!
### 1

> This error means that your site failed to build because the _config.yml file contains syntax errors.

> To troubleshoot, make sure that your _config.yml file follows these rules:

Use spaces instead of tabs.
Include a space after the : for each key value pair, like timezone: Africa/Nairobi.
Use only UTF-8 characters.
Quote any special characters, such as :, like title: "my awesome site: an adventure in parse errors".
For multi-line values, use | to create newlines and > to ignore newlines.
To identify any errors, you can copy and paste the contents of your YAML file into a YAML linter, such as YAML Validator.
